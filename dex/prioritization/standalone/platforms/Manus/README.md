# Manus — use as a skill

Manus supports **Skills** (file-based; can include SKILL.md). You can upload the prioritization skill so it appears in chat (e.g. via "/").

## Install

1. In Manus, open **Skills** (main menu).
2. **Upload a Skill:** choose **Upload** and select either:
   - The **standalone folder** (the folder that contains `SKILL.md`, `Prioritization_Playbook.md`, `Methods_Reference.md`), or
   - A **.zip** of that folder.
3. If Manus asks for a single file, use **SKILL.md** (it contains the full workflow; you can attach Methods_Reference.md in chat later if needed).
4. After upload, the skill is available in conversation (e.g. type `/` and pick prioritization).

## How to use

- Start a chat and invoke the skill (e.g. `/prioritization` or “use prioritization skill”).
- Follow the steps: context → method choice → items → run → get the result as markdown.
- If you need formulas or detailed method descriptions, attach **Methods_Reference.md** in the same chat.

## If upload is not available

- Paste the contents of **Prioritization_Playbook.md** into the chat and ask the assistant to follow it.
- Or use the one-shot prompt from the main **README.md** (Option C).
