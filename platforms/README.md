# Using PM skills in ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, and Manus

This pack of Product Management skills is designed for Cursor and Claude Code (skills folder). The same workflows can be used in **ChatGPT**, **Google Gemini**, **Grok**, and **Manus** by pasting instructions or uploading skill content where each platform allows.

## Summary by platform

| Platform   | How to use these skills |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| **ChatGPT** | Custom GPTs: create one GPT per skill (or one "PM Assistant" GPT). Paste the skill instructions into **Instructions**; optionally add reference files to **Knowledge**. See [ChatGPT.md](ChatGPT.md). |
| **Gemini**   | **Gems** (custom bots): create a Gem per skill and paste the skill instructions into the Gem. Or use **Personal instructions** (Settings → Personal Intelligence) for one global PM style. See [Gemini.md](Gemini.md). |
| **Grok**     | **Customize Grok** or **Workspaces**: paste skill instructions into "How would you like Grok to respond?". One workspace per skill or one combined instruction set. See [Grok.md](Grok.md). |
| **Manus**    | **Skills** (upload): Manus supports file-based skills. Upload a folder that contains `SKILL.md` (e.g. from this repo). See [Manus.md](Manus.md). |
